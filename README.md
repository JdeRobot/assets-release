This repository contains all models and worlds required by the JdeRobot exercises. An effort has been made to have minimal new models and reuse the official models as much as possible. This is due to the fact that any models that are available through the official sources and are not available in the system are automatically downloaded and saved for future usage(This does mean that the first time boot may be much slower - depending on one's internet connection)

The `kinetic-devel` branch is planned to be released on the official ROS build farm and hence is being reformatted for the same.
